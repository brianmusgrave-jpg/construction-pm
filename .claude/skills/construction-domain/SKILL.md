## Residential Construction Phases (GC/Owner View)

Standard 9-phase residential build sequence. Each phase is gated by inspections — you can't move to the next until the current one passes.

| # | Phase | Duration | Key Inspections |
|---|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Pre-Construction / Permitting | 2–8 wk | Permit approval |
| 2 | Site Work / Foundation | 2–4 wk | Footing, foundation |
| 3 | Framing | 2–6 wk | Framing inspection |
| 4 | Rough-In (MEP) | 2–4 wk | Rough plumbing, electrical, mechanical |
| 5 | Insulation & Drywall | 1–3 wk | Insulation inspection |
| 6 | Interior Finishes | 4–8 wk | Quality walkthroughs |
| 7 | Exterior Finishes | 2–4 wk | Varies by jurisdiction |
| 8 | Final MEP & Punch List | 1–2 wk | Final plumbing, electrical, mechanical |
| 9 | Certificate of Occupancy | 1–3 wk | Final building, fire marshal, CO |

## Phase Status Workflow
1. **Pending** → 2. **In Progress** → 3. **Review Requested** → 4. **Under Review** → 5. **Complete**

Maps to real inspection gates where you can't proceed until current phase passes.

## Field-Use UI Guidelines
- Big touch targets (dusty/wet hands)
- High contrast (bright sunlight)
- Offline capability (spotty connectivity)
- Easy camera access (photo documentation)
- One-tap status changes (not multi-step forms)
